        <p>Iâ€™m a student at Curry College studying software development graduating in May 2021. I have always had an
            interest in programming and software development since I was a kid. I had an invention book when I was
            little where I would write down different invention ideas I had. As I grew older I developed more and more
            passion for technology. I decided I wanted to go to school to learn more about programming and develop my
            passion for helping people through technology. Through my years at Curry College, I have taken classes in
            programming that have taught me the importance of clean code and how to learn skills independently. I have
            also participated and volunteered at Boston code seven times. One Boston code camp I presented on Wireshark,
            a network monitoring tool to help diagnose problems on a network to aid in fixing them. I am currently in my
            senior year, and I am a teaching assistant for introducing a computer science course. Through this
            experience, I have helped people understand programming concepts and have been writing labs for a new robot.
            My goals for the future are to become an applications programmer.</p>
